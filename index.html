		<p>I took a class called Compilers at Truman State. The professor talked about how
			compilers work and touched a fair bit on general programming language structure.
			The other students in the class were people I'd gotten to know well and the professor
			was my favorite in the department, so we had a lot of fun. We weren't afraid to ask
			semi-related questions and generally indulge our curiousities.
		</p>

		<p>I took a class called Computer Architecture and Organization also at Truman State. The
			class was interesting, but the professor was not good at communicating. He would ramble
			and tell stories and we were never quite sure what would be on the exam as a result. He
			also would refuse to promise a homework or study guide would exist or would exist by a
			certain date, which led to a lot of stress.
